This is the code base of AgentNetTool in [OpenCUA: Open Foundations for Computer-Use Agents](https://opencua.xlang.ai/). AgentNetTool is a cross-platform software to annotate computer-use agent tasks. It can record the full video with all the keyboard and mouse inputs as well as the other important system meta data (HTML, A11ytree elements, ...) during the annotator performing the task. 

## Document: Installation, Setup and User Guidelines
To use the AgentNetTool out of box, you can directly install AgentNetTool on your computer. Please follow the [AgentNetTool Documentation](https://agentnet-tool.xlang.ai/). The guide covers downloading, installation, setup, and instructions on how to start annotating with the tool.

## Build from source
If you‚Äôd like to build the tool from source or modify its code, please follow the instructions below.

Have Python >=3.11.

Clone this repo and `cd` into it:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/xlang-ai/AgentNetTool.git
$ cd AgentNetTool
```
